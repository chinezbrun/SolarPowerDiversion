0.5.1_20190421 - modif sursa JSON file din SYN to V4, line 158,172,240 - corectie pt a citi corect noul JSON, line 64,306 - cod pentru a copia rasp_log si rasp_error in locatia web v4
0.6.0_20190507 - use json from modbus folder , changed all related links
0.7.0_20190606 - directories restructured - update links 
0.8.0_20190617 - update cod to use external *.cfg file with variables, diversion available now (load 01) when diversion relay is closed forced
               - fix DC diversion in EQ or charged (use bat voltage)
               - fix calculation of grid/solar usage - now is based on voltage
               - reset usage time on specific hour 
               - error log subroutine simplified and add log for unknown error
0.9.0_20190622 - include compensated voltage for reference - variables name changed
0.9.1_20190630 - include EQ in diversion subroutine - in loop diversion by state
0.9.2_20190703 - minor design changes
0.9.3_20190712 - change load 1 logic - to alow one more loop for the case of load 2 inactive_skip (to reevaluate the battery and divert power)
1.0.0_20191016 - first release (GitHub)
               - data, info log renamed and path changed
               - small design modification for info log
               - file name changed, paths and name of config file 
               - bugfix:when the boiler temp file is empty, program exit with error - now is fixed
1.0.1_20200303 - include mqtt module - not used now - preparation for future transmission
1.1.0_20200414 - activate mqtt module for boiler temperature - integration with home assistant
1.1.1_20200428 - minor improvement on error treatment 
1.1.2_20200511 - change reference for load 2 (300w) 
1.1.3_20200704 - change reference for load1, load 2 (400W) 
1.2.0_20200914 - cleaning the code for unused options
               - revert 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.0 (not needed)
               - input/output data path clearly specified in config file
               - mqtt - push uptime (HA integration)
1.2.1_20201228 - enhancement: uptime calculation and reporting for HA
1.2.2_20210221 - enhancement: errors treatment, better reporting 
1.3.0_20211205 - functionality: replaced pushbullet with pushover 
                 enhancement: mqtt - now push diverted power relays states
                 minor change: uptime decimals changed
                 fixed: avoid divert when no PV
1.3.1_20220130 - enhancement: mqtt topics moved to config file
                 functionality: gpio24,25 reserved by program for further improvements
1.4.0_20220326 - fixed: divert relay always in divert by state mode
                        delay for MQTT commands (GPIO's, load1, load2, divertDC)
                 enhancement: now with 3 levels of divertion: load1, load2, load3 (GPIO 24), different reference power per load is posible now
                              code refactoring better integration of MQTT 
1.5.0_20220903 - enhancement: AC divertion is possible now in Grid_Tied mode
                              diversion by state mode no longer available - always true
                              introduced log and push notification for data integrity check alert
                              code refactoring for diversion levels 1-3
1.5.1_20240102 - bugfix
1.5.3_20240411 - bugfix, refactoring naming
---------------------------
know improvements: 
#1 load 1, 2 in config file , diverted reference power to be in line with loads -- implemented in 1.4.0 
#2 when boiler temperature is higher that reference, diversion stop - available power remains unknown - to investigate possibility to have sampling tests
